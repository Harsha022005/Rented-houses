# Rented-houses
I developed a rental house search platform using Node.js, Express, and JSON, designed to help users find houses based on location and family size. The platform includes a dynamic search filter, allowing users to browse properties that fit their needs quickly and efficiently. I focused on creating a responsive and user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth interaction across devices. The backend is lightweight, leveraging JSON to handle data efficiently, while Express manages routing to keep the app fast and organized. This project demonstrates my skills in backend development and my ability to create practical, user-centered web applications.
